# HumanSimulation
This is a simple java application where you can simulate humans searching for food. Each human has a different behaviour and will create variations on that behaviour when creating children. With this application, you can play around with different evoirements and test which behaviour will perform best.  

The jar file is located inside the out/artifacts/MyFirstGui_jar folder.  

# Features
- Adding humans and food to a 2d grid world.  
- Advancing time and viewing the behaviour of the humans in the 2d grid world.  
- Changing up the parameters of the grid world and humans (ex. choosing how much the humans need to eat and how often).  
- Creating a simple graph that shows the amount of humans as time goes on.  
- A information panel that displays information about all grid world entities or grid world entities at a certain position.
